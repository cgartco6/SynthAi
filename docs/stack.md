- **Containerization**: Docker

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (af-south-1 region)
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: ElastiCache Redis
- **Storage**: S3 + CloudFront
- **Networking**: VPC, ALB, Route53

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: Client makes request to CloudFront CDN
2. **Static Assets**: S3 serves React application
3. **API Calls**: ALB routes to backend ECS service
4. **Authentication**: JWT validation for protected routes
5. **AI Processing**: Backend calls AI services and models
6. **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL for structured data
7. **Caching**: Redis for session and frequent queries
8. **Async Tasks**: Celery for background processing

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
- VPC with public/private subnets
- Security groups for resource isolation
- WAF protection for web applications
- DDoS mitigation with Shield

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
- Database encryption with RDS
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Application Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling groups for ECS tasks
- Load balancer with health checks
- Database read replicas
- Redis cluster for cache scaling

### Vertical Scaling
- Database instance size increases
- ECS task memory/CPU adjustments
- CDN optimization for static assets

### Cost Optimization
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Reserved instances for predictable loads
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- CloudFront caching strategies

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics
- Application logs with structured logging
- Performance monitoring with X-Ray
- Business metrics with custom dashboards

### Alerting
- SNS for notification delivery
- CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
- PagerDuty integration for on-call
- Slack notifications for team awareness

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Flow
1. **Code Commit**: Git push triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and security tests
3. **Build**: Docker image creation and vulnerability scanning
4. **Deploy**: Blue-green deployment to ECS
5. **Verify**: Health checks and smoke tests
6. **Monitor**: Real-time monitoring and rollback if needed

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Feature development and testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live customer environment

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated RDS snapshots
- S3 versioning for static assets
- Regular ECR image backups
- Configuration backup with Terraform state

### Recovery Procedures
- Database restoration from snapshots
- Infrastructure recreation with Terraform
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Customer communication protocols

## South Africa Specific Considerations

### Data Residency
- All infrastructure in AWS af-south-1 region
- Compliance with POPIA regulations
- Local payment processing integration
- ZAR currency support throughout

### Performance
- CDN edge locations in South Africa
- Database optimization for local usage patterns
- Mobile network optimization
- Localized content delivery

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for the SynthAI platform while maintaining security and performance standards required for the South African market.
